# Brevity
---
As all university students have realised the value off , time is a commodity that is hard to maintain and manage during the hectic day to day of university life. Rewatching lectures take up a vital constitute of this time , a issue that brevity aims to solve. If whole lectures , usually about an hour long or so , are summarised into a 19 or 25 min read , then wouldn't it be more convinient.

Brevity takes in your recorded lectures , transcribes them using the innovative AssemblyAI transcrbing database and using the Sassbooks paraphrasing and summaring database to summarise that transcript.

Future Plan : Connect to a proper front-end database rather than using a command line interface
